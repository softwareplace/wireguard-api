# Application Configuration

This section explains how to configure and run the application using environment variables. The application uses
structured configuration via the `ApplicationEnv` struct, which is divided into application-level and database-level
settings.

## Application Environment Variables

The application reads its configuration from the following environment variables:

### General Configuration (`ApplicationEnv`)

| Variable                   | Description                                                             | Default Value              | Required? |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------|
| `API_SECRET_AUTHORIZATION` | Secret used to encrypt and decrypt API token claims.                    | N/A                        | Yes       |
| `API_SECRET_KEY`           | The api private key used for API security.                              | N/A                        | Yes       |
| `PORT`                     | The port on which the application runs.                                 | `1080`                     | No        |
| `CONTEXT_PATH`             | The base path used for API routing.                                     | `/api/private-network/v1/` | No        |
| `PEERS_RESOURCE_PATH`      | Filesystem path for peer resource connections.                          | `/etc/wireguard/`          | No        |
| `API_INIT_FILE`            | Add the first user data that will be created at the application startup | N/A                        | No        |

### Database Configuration (`DBEnv`)

| Variable         | Description                                               | Required? |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| `MONGO_DATABASE` | Name of the MongoDB database the application connects to. | Yes       |
| `MONGO_USERNAME` | Username for MongoDB authentication.                      | Yes       |
| `MONGO_PASSWORD` | Password for MongoDB authentication.                      | Yes       |
| `MONGO_URI`      | MongoDB connection URI.                                   | Yes       |

## Default Behavior

- The default **server port** is `1080` if `PORT` is not specified.
- The default **API context path** is `/api/private-network/v1/` if `CONTEXT_PATH` is not provided.
- The default path for **peer resources** is `/etc/wireguard/` if `PEERS_RESOURCE_PATH` is not provided.

## Example `.env` File

Here is an example `.env` file for setting up the environment variables:

``` env
# Server Configuration
API_SECRET_AUTHORIZATION=my-secret-for-auth
API_SECRET_KEY=my-api-secret-key
PORT=3000
CONTEXT_PATH=/custom/api/path/
PEERS_RESOURCE_PATH=/config/peers/

# Database Configuration
MONGO_DATABASE=my-app-database
MONGO_USERNAME=my-db-user
MONGO_PASSWORD=my-db-password
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017
```

## Startup app with docker

- **Note**: The following commands assume you have Docker installed on your machine and use the `./dev/.env` file that
  is not recommended for **production**.

```shell
make rebuild
```

## Startup app with a custom `.env` file

- Check the [`./dev/.env`](./dev/.env) file for the environment variables

```shell
make rebuild ENV=<< .env file path >>
```

## Configuration Initialization

The application initializes by loading environment variables during startup. Hereâ€™s how the variables work:

1. **General Configuration**:
    - Variables such as `API_SECRET_AUTHORIZATION` and `API_SECRET_KEY` are essential for securing API operations.
    - Optional fields like `PORT` and `CONTEXT_PATH` fallback to default values if not provided.

2. **Database Configuration**:
    - All `MONGO_*` variables (e.g., database name, URI, username, and password) are required to establish a successful
      MongoDB connection.
    - If a variable is missing, application startup will likely fail.

## Deployment Recommendations

- **Sensitive Variables**: Avoid committing sensitive information (e.g., secrets, API keys, passwords) to version
  control. Use tools like `.env` files (local development) or secret management systems (production).
- **Default Paths**: Make sure the paths, such as `PEERS_RESOURCE_PATH`, align with your intended filesystem structure
  in production environments.
- **Error Handling**: Ensure you have runtime checks for missing or misconfigured environment variables to prevent
  application crashes.
